          Everybody requires a minimum number of calories to live. This minimum number is called the basal metabolic
          rate (BMR). Your BMR is the number of calories your organs need to function while you perform no activity
          whatsoever. You can think of it as the amount of energy you'd burn if you stayed in bed all day.
          <br>
          Since your basal metabolic rate is based largely on involuntary functions like breathing and pumping blood,
          changes in your day-to-day activity don't do much to raise or lower this number. However, increasing muscle
          mass does increase BMR, because muscle is metabolically "hungry" and it takes more energy to maintain more
          muscle. This means that when you have a lot of muscle mass, you'll burn more calories at rest

          A healthy eating plan gives your body the nutrients it needs every day while staying within your daily calorie
          goal for weight loss. A healthy eating plan also will lower your risk for heart disease and other health
          conditions.
          <br>
          A healthy eating plan:
          - Emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat dairy products
          <br>
          - Includes lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts
          <br>
          - Limits saturated and trans fats, sodium, and added sugars
          <br>
          - Controls portion sizes

          The term “basal metabolic index,” or BMI, is bandied about in popular health magazines and at fitness centers.
          In fact, before you hire a personal trainer, your BMI score may be determined. But you may be wondering what
          it is and if there is real science behind it. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
          (CDC), BMI is legitimate.
          <br>
          Like your index finger, or pointer, BMI points to something. It indicates body fatness or obesity. By plugging
          your height and weight into a mathematical formula, healthcare professionals can derive your BMI, a good
          assessment of your body fat. There are also adult BMI calculators available online. Determining your BMI can
          then be used to predict your risk of developing medical conditions that go hand in hand with excess weight.
          The normal range for BMI in adults is 18.5-24.9, says the CDC. Values between 25 and 29.9 indicate a person is
          overweight. When the BMI climbs above 30, a person is considered obese.

          Every day you lose water through your breath, perspiration, urine and bowel movements. For your body to
          function properly, you must replenish its water supply by consuming beverages and foods that contain water.
          <br>
          So how much fluid does the average, healthy adult living in a temperate climate need? The National Academies
          of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine determined that an adequate daily fluid intake is:
          <br>
          -About 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids for men
          <br>
          -About 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids a day for women
